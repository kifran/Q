1. Modify loadlog.q to take the name of a log file from the command line and load it.  Print a success or failure message when the log has been loaded correctly.  Use this to load log file 1.
2. Load log file 2.  What happens?
3. Modify the script to trap any errors and print an error message to the screen.  
4. Capture each "bad" log message into a variable, badmsgs.
5. Modify the function to print a meaningful description of what the error encountered was.  Maybe the column lengths, types, are wrong, maybe tables don't exist.
