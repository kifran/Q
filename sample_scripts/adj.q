\
customers choose between nightly calculation of adjustments
or apply on the fly. (millions per second.) we recommend the latter.
 
all we need is a small table of events loaded into the database.
([sym;date]adjustment)
queries can be wrapped in stored procedures to make this easier.

taq ftp's and dvd's come with simple cusip master tables.
this information is incomplete and can be added to in this script.
dividend and split information needs to be supplied from elsewhere.
since this data can change every day we store the raw sym and price
and apply daily adjustments on the fly. (millions per second)
intraday calculations, e.g. returns, do not require adjustment.

we could store adjustments for every day and sym but 
mas,date,sym,adj for 30000 syms over 3000 days is 2GB.
we just need the changes and mark them 'asof'(`s#..)

mergers can be handled as a surviving company. e.g. XOM 19991201 XON (MOB stops)
master can be anything. e.g. here it is last known sym.

note we should do:

.. where sym in SMD[M;date]

not

.. where MSD[sym;date]in M

because the table is indexed by sym

splits(and dividends)

typical source data is:

([sym;date]split)
e.g.(made up)
HWP 1996.06.30 1.5
HPQ 2000.10.30 2

we need to turn that into:

([mas;date]runningadjustment)

HPQ 0N         .333..
HPQ 1996.06.30 .5
HPQ 2000.10.30 1


so that master asof today is HPQ
adjustment
asof 2000.10.30 is 1
asof 1996.06.30 is .5
before that is .333
